How To Make Project with Git, Demoboard, TouchGFX, STMCube and your own project name

close down stmcube and touchgfx
Setup project in git. 

make workspace folder under project folder. 
if reusing workspace folder, then delete everything in it. 

Create project in touchgfx using demo board eg. "STM32F746G_Disco", desired project name eg."MyProject" and select workspace folder as directory.
Add content 
generate code
save 


STM32F746G_Disco     F746G_Bike   //for cutting and pasting only



In file explorer goto MyProject folder, delete EWarm and MDK-ARM folders (used for other compilers)

Use Notepad++ find in files to replace almost all instances of "STM32F746G_Disco" with "MyProject". from the project folder, not the workspace folder e.g. C:\Code\ProjectsGit\BikeGenerator\BikeSTWorkspace\F746G_Bike 
Leave the one in the readme.md "Supports flashing of the STM32F746G_Disco board" as it wont make any sense.

In file explorer search for files of "Demoboard name" in sub folders of {workspace}\MyProject  replace "Demoboard name" with these to "MyProject"

Open .project file this should import project into STMCube wait for successful import message 30 seconds
