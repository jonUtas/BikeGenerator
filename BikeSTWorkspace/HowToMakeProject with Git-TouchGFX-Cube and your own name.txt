How To Make Project with Git, Demoboard, TouchGFX, STMCube and your own project name

Setup project in git. 

make workspace folder under project folder. 

Create project in touchgfx using demo board eg. "STM32F746G_Disco", desired project name eg."MyProject" and select workspace folder as directory.
Add content 
generate code
save 


In file explorer goto MyProject folder, delete EWarm and MDK-ARM folders (used for other compilers)

Use Notepad++ find in files to replace almost all instances of "STM32F746G_Disco" with "MyProject". 
Leave the one in the readme.md "Supports flashing of the STM32F746G_Disco board" as it wont make any sense.

In file explorer search for files of "Demoboard name" in sub folders of {workspace}\MyProject  replace "Demoboard name" with these to "MyProject"

Open .project file this should import project into STMCube wait for successful import message 30 seconds
